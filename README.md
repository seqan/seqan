| **NOTE <br> [SeqAn3 is out and hosted in a different repository](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3)**  |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| We recommend using SeqAn3 for new applications.                                                      |

## What Is SeqAn?

SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data.
Our library applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality, extensibility, and integration with other libraries.
SeqAn is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss of performance.

## License

The SeqAn library itself, the tests and demos are licensed under the very permissive 3-clause BSD License.
The licenses for the applications themselves can be found in the LICENSE files.

## Prerequisites

Older compiler versions might work but are not supported.

### Linux, macOS, FreeBSD
  * GCC ≥ 10
  * Clang/LLVM ≥ 11
  * Intel Compiler ≥ 2022.1.0 (Intel OneAPI)

### Windows
  * Visual C++ ≥ 17.0 / Visual Studio ≥ 2022

### Architecture support
  * Intel/AMD platforms, including optimisations for modern instruction sets (`POPCNT`, `SSE4`, `AVX2`, `AVX512`)
  * All Debian release architectures supported, including most ARM and all PowerPC platforms.

### Build system
  * To build tests, demos, and official SeqAn applications you also need CMake ≥ 3.12.

Some official applications might have additional requirements or only work on a subset of platforms.
