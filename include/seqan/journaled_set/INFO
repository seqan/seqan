Description: Implements the journaled set.
  A journaled set can efficiently store multiple large sequences,
  while journaling redundancies between each sequence and a given
  reference sequence.
  .
  Note, in the moment sequences can be added and compressed only
  with standard DP programming. Hence, the sequences are somewhat
  restricted in their seize. But we'll support large-scale sequence
  alignments very soon, i.e., genomic sized sequences can be added too.
