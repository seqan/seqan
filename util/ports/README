To test the SeqAn port do the following:

cd seqan-trunk/util/ports
portindex

Then add the path to your port sources, i.e. by adding the following line to
the end of the file /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf:

file:///Users/YOURUSERNAME/seqan-trunk/util/ports

Then install the SeqAn port by:

sudo port install seqan seqan-apps
