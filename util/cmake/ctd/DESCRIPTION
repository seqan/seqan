SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures
for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data. SeqAn is free
software available under the three clause BSD license and runs under Windows,
MacOSX and Linux. The library applies a unique generic design that guarantees
high performance, generality, extensibility, and integration with other
libraries. SeqAn is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software
tools with a minimal loss of performance.
