SeqAn - The Library for Sequence Analysis
=========================================

What Is SeqAn?
--------------

SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data.
Our library applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality, extensibility, and integration with other libraries.
SeqAn is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss of performance.

License
-------

The SeqAn library itself, the tests and demos are licensed under the very permissing 3-clause BSD License.
The licenses for the applications themselves can be found in the LICENSE files.

Prerequisites
-------------------

The library is tested on the following compilers:
  * GCC >= 4.7 (e.g. Debian stable/wheezy)
  * Clang >= 3.3 (e.g. Xcode >= 5)
  * Visual C++ 10 (2010), 11 (2012), 12 (2013)

All operating systems supported by the respective compilers should work with SeqAn. We test on 32-bit and 64-bit Intel/AMD architectures.

To build tests, demos, and official SeqAn applications you also need:
  * CMake >= 2.8.2 (http://cmake.org/)

Some of the official applications might have additional requirements or work only on a subset of platforms.
