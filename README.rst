SeqAn - The Library for Sequence Analysis
=========================================

What Is SeqAn?
--------------

SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data.
Our library applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality, extensibility, and integration with other libraries.
SeqAn is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss of performance.

License
-------

The SeqAn library itself, the tests and demos are licensed under the very permissing 3-clause BSD License.
The licenses for the applications themselves can be found in the LICENSE files.

Prerequisites
-------------------

Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD:
  * GCC ≥ 5 [limited GCC-4.9 support on Linux]
  * Clang/LLVM ≥ 3.6 [limited Clang-3.5 support on Linux]
  * Intel Compiler ≥ 17.0.0 on Linux
Windows:
  * Visual C++ ≥ 14.0 / Visual Studio ≥ 2015
  * Intel Compiler ≥ 17.0.0 / Visual Studio ≥ 2015u2
  * Clang/C2 ≥ 3.8.0 / Visual Studio ≥ 2015u3 [experimental, requires CMake ≥ 3.6]

Architecture support:
  * Intel/AMD platforms, including optimisations for modern instruction sets (``POPCNT``, ``SSE4``, ``AVX2``, ``AVX512``)
  * All Debian release architectures supported, including most ARM and all PowerPC platforms.

To build tests, demos, and official SeqAn applications you also need:
  * CMake ≥ 3.0 [CMake ≥ 3.4 recommended]

Some of the official applications might have additional requirements or work only on a subset of platforms.
