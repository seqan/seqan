NAME
       cmp - compare two files byte by byte

SYNOPSIS
       cmp [OPTION]... FILE1 [FILE2 [SKIP1 [SKIP2]]]

DESCRIPTION
       Compare two files byte by byte.

       -b  --print-bytes
              Print differing bytes.

       -i SKIP  --ignore-initial=SKIP
              Skip the first SKIP bytes of input.

       -i SKIP1:SKIP2  --ignore-initial=SKIP1:SKIP2

              Skip the first SKIP1 bytes of FILE1 and the first
              SKIP2 bytes of FILE2.

       -l  --verbose
              Output byte numbers and values of  all  differing
              bytes.

       -n LIMIT  --bytes=LIMIT
              Compare at most LIMIT bytes.

       -s  --quiet  --silent
              Output nothing; yield exit status only.

       -v  --version
              Output version info.

       --help Output this help.

       SKIP1  and SKIP2 are the number of bytes to skip in each
       file.  SKIP values may be followed by the following mul-
       tiplicative  suffixes:  kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1,000,000, M
       1,048,576, GB 1,000,000,000, G 1,073,741,824, and so  on
       for T, P, E, Z, Y.

       If  a FILE is `-' or missing, read standard input.  Exit
       status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if
       trouble.
