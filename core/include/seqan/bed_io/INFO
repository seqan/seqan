Description: I/O routines for BED files.
 BED files allow the easy representation of intervals on the genome.
 Originally, they were designed for tracks in the UCSC genome browser.
 The original format has 12 columns but often variants using fewer
 columns with interpreted data are used and the rest is kept as application
 dependent data.
 .
 This module provides data structures for storing such records and routines
 for loading and writing BED files.
