Description: Mason is a read simualtor for NGS data.
 Mason is a read simulator software for Illumina, 454 and Sanger reads. Its 
 features include position specific error rates and base quality values.
 For Illumina reads, it uses a comprehensive analysis with empirical data
 for the error and quality model. For the other technologies, models from
 the literature are used.
 .
 Mason has been written with performance in mind and can sample reads from
 large genomes.
