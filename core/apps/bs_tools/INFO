Description: One-line description for app bs_tools.
 This is the long text description for the app.  You should wrap text to 78
 characters and you have to wrap it to 80 characters.  The lines must have one
 leading space.  Successive lines in this format will be word-wrapped when
 displayed.  Leading space is stripped off.
 .
 Use empty lines with one dot to insert an empty line / break paragraphs.
 .
  Start lines with two spaces to make them display verbatim.  Lines that
  cannot be displayed horizontally will be hard-wrapped (not at word bor-
  ders), so maybe do your own hyphenation.
 .
 Do not use tab characters, their effect is not predictable.
 .
 The INFO file format is oriented after the Debian controfields format.
