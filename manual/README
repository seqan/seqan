Building the SeqAn Manual
=========================

It is best to install the dependencies in a virtualenv environment.  You can
find out more here:

Installing Prerequisites
------------------------

There is a file `requirements.txt` in the `manual` folder.  You can use the
`pip` command to install these packages.

    # pip install -r manual/requirements.txt

Building the Manual
----------------

    # cd manual
    # make html

Trouble-Shooting
----------------

If you get a problem with the UTF-8 localtes (e.g. on Mac Os X), then you have
to add the following two lines to your `~/.bash_profile`.

    export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
