The SeqAn tutorials are the best way to get started with learning how to develop using SeqAn.
In contrast, the `API Documentation <http://docs.seqan.de/>`_ gives more comprehensive but less verbose documentation about the library while the How-Tos are strictly task driven and narrower in scope.

The main audience of the tutorials are graduate students and professionals who want to learn how to use SeqAn.
Previous programming knowledge is required, knowledge of C++ is recommended.

.. rubric:: :rubric-heading1:`Introduction`

These tutorials show you how to get started with SeqAn, including the :ref:`installation <tutorial-getting-started>`.
Then, you can learn about the background and motivation of SeqAn.
You should then definitely start your engines and read the :ref:`tutorial-first-steps-in-seqan` tutorial to see an example highlighting many important concepts in the SeqAn library.

:ref:`tutorial-getting-started`
  This tutorial will walk you through the installation of SeqAn and its dependencies.
  Then, you will create your first minimal SeqAn application!

:ref:`tutorial-first-steps-in-seqan`
  This tutorial gives practical examples and applications of the most important basic techniques.
  You should read this tutorial if you are starting out with SeqAn.

:ref:`tutorial-background-and-motivation`
  This tutorial gives an overview over the design aims and principles of SeqAn and a motivation for the employed mechanisms.

We highly recommend you to follow the Getting Started instructions if you are starting out with SeqAn.
Note that it is also possible to use SeqAn strictly as a library with your own build system.
The article :ref:`build-manual-integration-with-your-own-build-system` contains detailed information about this.

  This section of the tutorial introduces you to the graph type in SeqAn.
  We will discuss the various graph specializations and show you how to create directed and undirected graphs as well as HMMs, how to store additional information for edges and vertices and last but not least how to apply standard algorithms to the graphs.

.. rubric:: :rubric-heading2:`Input/Output`

:ref:`tutorial-input-output-overview`

:ref:`tutorial-sequence-io`
  This tutorial explains how to access FASTA, FASTQ, EMBL and GenBank sequence files.

:ref:`tutorial-indexed-fasta-io`
  This tutorial explains how to use FASTA index files for quick random access within FASTA files: read contigs or just sections without having to read through whole FASTA file.

:ref:`tutorial-sam-bam-io`

First, congratulations on becoming an offical SeqAn developer!
After you went through the tutorials and before you actually start to develop your own application with SeqAn you might want to learn :ref:`how-to-write-tests` and read about the :ref:`API documentation <style-guide-dox-api-docs>`.
In addition, we follow a SeqAn specific :ref:`style-guide`.
Information like this can be found on the section site.
There are plenty of information completing your knowledge about SeqAn so have a look!

.. rubric:: :rubric-heading2:`Frequently used Software Techniques`

We assume that the user is acquainted with the basic data types of SeqAn, the introductory example and the demo programs.
Also you should be acquainted with the STL and template programming.
In this Section we introduce the three main techniques of programming in SeqAn, namely the *global function interface*, the use of
*Metafunctions*, and the concept of *Template subclassing*.

:ref:`tutorial-basic-techniques`
  Here we remind you of the basics of template programming and the use of the STL.

:ref:`tutorial-metafunctions`
  In this section you find an introductory explanation how Metafunctions are used in SeqAn to obtain information about data types used which will only be instantiated at compile time.

  In this section you find a short example that illustrates the power of template subclassing.

:ref:`tutorial-global-function-interface`
  In this section you find a useful piece of code that shows you the flexibility of the global function interface.
