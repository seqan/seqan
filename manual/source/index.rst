SeqAn Manual
============

This is the manual of the SeqAn library.
SeqAn is the C++ template library for the analysis of biological sequences.
It contains algorithms and data structures for

* string representation and their manipluation,
* online and indexed string search,
* efficient I/O of bioinformatics file formats,
* sequence alignment, and
* many many more.


.. todo:: Finish this overview part here.

This page is structured in three sections. If you are new to SeqAn and you want to learn more about it, how to use it, and how to get up and running then read the :ref:`tutorial-getting-started` ...
If you are already aquainted to SeqAn and you are looking for specific problems, have a look at our HowTos.  ...
If you want to contribute or or start as a SeqAn-Developer look into the Developer Documentation section which gives you all the details about the infrastructure, architecture and how things are done in SeqAn.
