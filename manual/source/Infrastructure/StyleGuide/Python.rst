SeqAn Python Style Guide
========================

Some very few points:

* Follow `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
* Use single-quotes for strings, i.e. ``'this is a string'`` and double-quotes for docstrings, e.g. ``"""This is a docstring."""``.
* Name functions, classes, constants as in SeqAn, variables and member variables are named ``lower_case_with_underscores``.
