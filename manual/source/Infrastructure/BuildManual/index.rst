Build Manual
============

Before you can start using the SeqAn library you have to make sure that it is installed and setup correctly:

  * :ref:`Setting Up SeqAn <infra-build-manual-install>`

Once this is done you have two choices for using SeqAn:

  * :ref:`Use CMake and our CMake-Module <infra-build-manual-cmake>`
  * :ref:`Use your own build system <infra-build-manual-custom>`

We highly recommend using the CMake-Module as it correctly handles many settings you otherwise need to set manually. It also provides the best cross-platform compatibility.
