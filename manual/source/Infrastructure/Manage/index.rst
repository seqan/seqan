Team Guide
==========

This guide is aimed at all people who contribute to SeqAn on a regular basis, and especially those that are responsible for certain parts of it. Downstream package maintainers should also read some of the articles, especially the :ref:`Releases page <infra-manage-deploy>`.

It includes a description of the repository structure, detailed conventions and instructions, as well as documentation of the nightly build system.
