Getting Started with CUDA
-------------------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to follow this HowTo, you need:

   *  git to download the sources
   *  cmake to build the projects
   *  the CUDA toolkit >= v5.0 to compile the CUDA demos
   *  a CUDA-capable GPU with SM architecture >= 2.0 to run the CUDA demos

Refer to :ref:`tutorial-getting-started` for detailed SeqAn installation
instructions.

Getting the source code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CUDA acceleration resides in the develop branch of SeqAn, hosted on `GitHub <http://github.com/seqan/>`_.
Execute the following command to get the last sources:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone -b develop https://github.com/seqan/seqan.git SeqAn

Compiling the demos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hello CUDA
^^^^^^^^^^

Let us first setup the build system:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir SeqAn-Builds && cd SeqAn-Builds
    $ cmake ../SeqAn -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Now we can compile and execute our `CUDA hello world <http://github.com/seqan/seqan/tree/develop/demos/cuda/hello.cu>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make demo_cuda_hello
    $ bin/demo_cuda_hello
    Hello CUDA!

.. important::

    Some users experienced compilation problems on Mac OS X.
    If the compilation fails with: **clang: error: unsupported option '-dumpspecs**, then you need to manually create links to gcc 4.4 in the nvcc directory.
    If you for example installed gcc44 via MacPorts in ``/opt/local/bin`` you can create these links as follows:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ ln -s /opt/local/bin/gcc-mp-4.4 /usr/local/cuda/bin/gcc
       $ ln -s /opt/local/bin/g++-mp-4.4 /usr/local/cuda/bin/g++

MMap String
^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's try the `MMap String demo <http://github.com/seqan/seqan/tree/develop/demos/cuda/mmap.cu>`_.
This demo maps a text file in memory, copies it on the device and uses Thrust to count the number of occurrences of a given character into the file.

.. code-block:: console

    $ make demo_cuda_mmap
    $ echo "THIS IS A TEST" > test.txt
    $ bin/demo_cuda_mmap test.txt T
    3

FM-index counting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `FM-index counting demo <http://github.com/seqan/seqan/tree/develop/demos/cuda/count.cu>`_ builds an FM-index over a static text.
Given a set of patterns, the program counts - both on the host and on the device - the total number of occurrences of all patterns in the text.

.. code-block:: console

    $ make demo_cuda_count
    $ bin/demo_cuda_count ACGTACGTACGTACGT ACGT GTA
    CPU Occurrences: 7
    GPU Occurrences: 7
