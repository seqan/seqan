String Sets
===========

Learning Objective
  You will learn the advantages of StringSets and how to work with them.

Difficulty
  Basic

Duration
  15 min

Prerequisites
  :ref:`tutorial-datastructures-sequences`

A set of sequences can either be stored in a sequence of sequences, for example in a ``String<String<char> >``, or in a :dox:`StringSet`.
This tutorial will introduce you to the SeqAn class :dox:`StringSet`, its background and how to use it.

Background
----------

One advantage of using :dox:`StringSet` is that it supports the function :dox:`StringSet#concat` that returns a *concatenator* of all sequences in the string set.
A *concatenator* is an object that represents the concatenation of a set of strings.
This way, it is possible to build up index data structures for multiple sequences by using the same construction methods as for single sequences.

There are two kinds of :dox:`StringSet` specializations in SeqAn: :dox:`OwnerStringSet Owner StringSet`, the default specialisation, and :dox:`DependentStringSet Dependent StringSet`; see the list below for details.
:dox:`OwnerStringSet Owner StringSets` actually store the sequences, whereas :dox:`DependentStringSet Dependent StringSets` just refer to sequences that are stored outside of the string set.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/base.cpp
      :fragment: example_sets

The specialization :dox:`ConcatDirectStringSet ConcatDirecet StringSet` already stores the sequences in a concatenation.
The concatenators for all other specializations of :dox:`StringSet` are **virtual** sequences, that means their interface **simulates** a concatenation of the sequences, but they do not literally concatenate the sequences into a single sequence.
Hence, the sequences do not need to be copied when a concatenator is created.

One string can be an element of several :dox:`DependentStringSet Dependent StringSets`.
Typical tasks are, e.g., to find a specific string in a string set, or to test whether the strings in two string sets are the same.
Therefore a mechanism to identify the strings in the string set is needed, and, for performance reasons, this identification should not involve string comparisons.
SeqAn solves this problem by introducing *ids*, which are by default ``unsigned int`` values.

The following list lists the different :dox:`StringSet` specializations:

Specialization ``Owner<ConcatDirect>``
  The sequences are stored as parts of a long string.
  Since the sequences are already concatenated, :dox:`StringSet#concat` just needs to return this string.
  The string set also stores lengths and starting positions of the strings.
  Inserting new strings into the set or removing strings from the set is more expensive than for the default :dox:`OwnerStringSet` specialization, since this involves moving all subsequent sequences in memory.

Specialization ``Owner<JournaledSet>``
  The sequences are stored as :dox:`JournaledString Journaled Strings` to a common reference sequence,
  that is also stored within the container.
  When adding a new String to the set, it needs to be joined to this set of sequences which are all based on the
  common reference sequence.
  This way one can hold a large collection of similar sequences efficiently in memory.

Specialization ``Dependent<Tight>``
  This specialization stores sequence pointers consecutively in an array.
  Another array stores an id value for each sequence.
  That means that accessing given an id needs a search through the id array.

    .. warning::
        The Dependent-Tight StringSet is deprecated and will likely be removed
        within the SeqAn-2.x lifecycle.

Specialization ``Dependent<Generous>``
  The sequence pointers are stored in an array at the position of their ids.
  If a specific id is not present, the array stores a zero at this position.
  The advantage of this specialization is that accessing the sequence given its id is very fast.
  On the other hand, accessing a sequence given its position ``i`` can be expensive, since this means we have to find the *i*-th non-zero value in the array of sequence pointers.
  The space requirements of a string set object depends on the largest id rather than the number of sequences stored in the set.
  This could be inefficient for string sets that store a small subset out of a large number of sequences.

Building String Sets
--------------------

Use the function :dox:`StringConcept#appendValue` to append strings to string sets.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_functionality.cpp
      :fragment: appendValue


Working with StringSets
-----------------------

This section will give you a short overview of the functionality of the class :dox:`StringSet`.

There are two ways for accessing the sequences in a string set: (1) the function :dox:`RandomAccessContainerConcept::operator[]` returns a reference to the sequence at a specific *position* within the sequence of sequences, and (2) :dox:`StringSet#valueById` accesses a sequence given its *id*.
We can retrieve the *id* of a sequence in a :dox:`StringSet` with the function :dox:`StringSet#positionToId`.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_functionality.cpp
      :fragment: retrieve_id

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_functionality.cpp.stdout

In the case of :dox:`OwnerStringSet Owner StringSets`, id and position of a string are always the same, but for :dox:`DependentStringSet Dependent StringSets`, the ids can differ from the positions.
For example, if a :dox:`DependentStringSet Dependent StringSet` is used to represent subsets of strings that are stored in :dox:`OwnerStringSet Owner StringSets`, one can use the position of the string within the :dox:`OwnerStringSet Owner StringSet` as id of the strings.
With the function :dox:`StringSet#assignValueById`, we can add the string with a given id from the source string set to the target string set.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_functionality_2.cpp
      :fragment: main

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_functionality_2.cpp.stdout
      :fragment: main

With the function :dox:`StringSet#positionToId` we can show that, in this case, the position and the id of a string are different.


.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_functionality_2.cpp
      :fragment: difference

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_functionality_2.cpp.stdout
      :fragment: difference

Iterating over String Sets
--------------------------

As well as for other containers, SeqAn has implemented iterators for :dox:`StringSet StringSets`.
The following example illustrates, how to iterate over the :dox:`StringSet`.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_iterators.cpp
      :fragment: simple_example

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_iterators.cpp.stdout
      :fragment: simple_example

If we want to iterate over the contained :dox:`String Strings` as well, as if the :dox:`StringSet` would be one sequence, we can use the function :dox:`StringSet#concat` to get the concatenation of all sequences.
Therefore we first use the metafunction :dox:`StringSet#Concatenator` to receive the type of the concatenation.
Then, we can simply build an iterator for this type and iterate over the concatenation of all strings.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_iterators.cpp
      :fragment: concatenator

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/example_iterators.cpp.stdout
      :fragment: concatenator

Assignment 1

     Review

   Objective
     Build a string set with default specialization and which contains the strings ``"AAA"``, ``"CCC"``, ``"GGG"`` and ``"TTT"``.
     After that print the length of the string set and use a simple for-loop to print all elements of the strings set.

Assignment 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: assignment

    Type
      Application

    Objective
      In this task you will test, whether a :dox:`DependentStringSet Dependent StringSet` contains a string without comparing the actual sequences.
      Use the given code frame below and adjust it in the following way:

      #. Build a :dox:`OwnerStringSet Owner StringSet` to store the given strings.
      #. Get the corresponding ids for each position and store them.
      #. Build a :dox:`DependentStringSet` and assign the strings of the owner string set from position 0,1 and 3 by their id to it.
      #. Write a function ``isElement`` which takes a ``StringSet<Dependent<> >`` and a ``Id`` as arguments and checks whether a string set contains a string with a given id.
      #. Check if the string set contains the string of position ``3`` and ``2`` and print the result.

      .. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/string_sets/assignment_2.cpp

   Hints
     You can use the SeqAn functions :dox:`StringSet#positionToId` and :dox:`StringSet#assignValueById`.
