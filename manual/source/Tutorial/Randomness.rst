Randomness
----------

Learning Objective
 In this tutorial, you will get a short walk-through of SeqAn's module ``random``.
 The module contains code for generating random numbers in various distributions.

Difficulty
 Basic

Duration
  10 min

Prerequisites
  :ref:`tutorial-first-steps-in-seqan`, :ref:`tutorial-sequences`

This tutorial explains how to use the module ``random``.
``random`` primarily provides the two classes :dox:`Rng` (**R**\ andom **N**\ umber **G**\ enerator) and :dox:`Pdf` (**P**\ robability **D**\ ensity **F**\ unctions).

.. warning::
  This module is deprecated in favor of C++11 random number generation facilities.

Random Number Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instances of the class :dox:`Rng` are responsible for random number generation.
Currently, SeqAn provides only one specialization, the :dox:`MersenneTwisterRng`.
This class is used for generating random 32-bit numbers.
These 32-bit numbers are then used by the :dox:`Pdf` specializations to generate random numbers in certain distributions as explained further below.

The following program gives an example.
First, we include the header ``<seqan/random.h>`` to get access to the module's functionality.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/random/random_examples.cpp
   :fragment: header

During the initialization of the :dox:`Rng` object you have to pass a seed used as a start point for the randomization.
Finally, function :dox:`Rng#pickRandomNumber` picks a random number from a :dox:`Rng`.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/random/random_examples.cpp
   :fragment: random-number-generation-raw

The output of this fragment is:

.. code-block:: console

   pickRandomNumber(rng) == 1608637542

:dox:`MersenneTwisterRng Mersenne Twister Rng` generates 32-bit ``unsigned`` numbers.
However, you should not rely on any specific type and use :dox:`Value` metafunction instead.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/random/random_examples.cpp
   :fragment: random-number-generation-metafunction-value

If you prefer a special distribution of the randomly generated numbers you can use the above mentioned specializations of :dox:`Pdf`.
SeqAn currently provides normal, log-normal and uniform probability density functions.
Note, for uniform distributions the range of values is given as a closed interval, i.e. the last value is enclosed in the range.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/random/random_examples.cpp
   :fragment: random-number-generation-pdf

The output of this fragment is:

.. code-block:: console

   pickRandomNumber(rng, uniformDouble) == 0.950714
   pickRandomNumber(rng, uniformInt) == 27
   pickRandomNumber(rng, normal) == 0.419823

Also note that you can initialize the :dox:`LogNormalPdf Log-Normal Pdf` either with mean and standard deviation of the log-normal distribution or the underlying normal distribution.
By default, you initialize it with the mean and standard deviation (mu and sigma) of the underlying normal distribution.
Use the tags :dox:`LognormalConstructionTags#MuSigma` and :dox:`LognormalConstructionTags#MeanStdDev` in the constructor to select a mode.

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/random/random_examples.cpp
   :fragment: random-number-generation-log-normal

.. code-block:: console

   pickRandomNumber(rng, logNormal) == 1.22431
   pickRandomNumber(rng, logNormal2) == 2.78004
   pickRandomNumber(rng, logNormal3) == 0.00155248

Shuffling
~~~~~~~~~

The function :dox:`shuffle` allows to shuffle a container, given a random number generator:

.. includefrags:: demos/tutorial/random/random_examples.cpp
   :fragment: shuffling

The output of this fragment is:

.. code-block:: console

   shuffle("Hello World!") == oreWlloHld
