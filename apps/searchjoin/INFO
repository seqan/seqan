Description: String Similarity Search/Join.
  Implementation of scalable algorithms for optimal string similarity search
  and join.
  .
  Our methods are variations of those applied in Masai, our recently published
  tool for mapping high-throughput DNA sequencing data with unpreceded speed
  and accuracy. The key features of our approach are filtration with
  approximate seeds and methods for multiple backtracking. Approximate seeds,
  compared to exact seeds, increase filtration specificity while preserving
  sensitivity. Multiple backtracking amortizes the cost of searching a large
  set of seeds. Combined together, these two methods significantly speed up
  string similarity search and join operations.
