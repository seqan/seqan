1. Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SnpStore is a program for SNP and indel calling in mapped next-generation
sequencing read data. 
It features a simple threshold-based model for SNP and indel calling, and
a MAQ-like Bayesian model for SNP genotype calling. 
Reads can optionally be realigned, using the ReAligner algorithm by Anson
and Myers.

Please note: SnpStore is work in progress! Keep yourself up to date by 
checking out the latest version of SnpStore from the SeqAn SVN repository
(instructions follow below).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SnpStore is distributed with SeqAn - The C++ Sequence Analysis Library (see 
http://www.seqan.de). To build SnpStore do the following:

  1)  Download the latest snapshot of SeqAn
  2)  Unzip it to a directory of your choice (e.g. seqan)
  3)  cd seqan/projects/library/cmake
  4)  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  5)  make snp_store
  6)  ./apps/snp_store

Alternatively - and this is what I recommend - you can check out the latest 
SVN version of SnpStore and SeqAn with:

  1)  svn co http://svn.mi.fu-berlin.de/seqan/trunk/seqan
  2)  cd seqan/build
  3)  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  5)  make snp_store
  7)  ./apps/snp_store

If successful, an executable file snp_store was built and a brief usage 
description was dumped.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Usage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage: snp_store [OPTIONS]... <REFERENCE.fa> <MAPPED_READS.gff> 

SnpStore expects at least two files: the reference sequence in (Multi-)Fasta format
and the mapped reads in GFF or SAM/BAM format. For a description of this GFF format 
see section 4.1. 
Multiple mapped read files can be specified by listing multiple GFF files, 
i.e. file1.gff file2.gff.

To produce output files, at least one of the two options "-o" (output file 
for SNPs) and "-id" (output file for indels) needs to be specified. 

In default mode, SNPs/indels are called only at positions that are covered
by at least 2 reads. 
The default behaviour can be modified by adding the following options to 
the command line:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. Options
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  -o,  --output FILE
  
  Specify output filename (default: off). SNPs will only be called if an
  output filename is specified.
  
  -of, --output-format NUM              
  
  Output format for SNP file:   0 = output all candidate SNPs (default)
                                1 = output only succesful candidate SNPs, 
                                    i.e. actual SNP calls
  See section 4.2 for a detailed description of the output formats.
                   
  -sq, --show-qualities   
  
  Show ASCII quality values in SNP output file. 
  Again, see section 4.2 for details.

  -id, --indel-file FILE
  
  Output file for called indels in GFF format (off). Indels will only be 
  called if a filename is specified.

  -m,  --method NUM 
  
  Set method used for SNP calling       0 = threshold method
                                        1 = MAQ-like Bayesian method (default)
  See below ("SNP calling options") for options specific to each method.
  
  -mc, --min-coverage NUM    
  
  Only inspect positions that are covered by a minimum of NUM reads (2).

  -re, --realign
  
  Realign reads using Anson's and Myers' ReAligner algorithm. See Anson, E. 
  and Myers, E. "ReAligner: A Program for Refining DNA Sequence Multi-
  Alignments." Journal of Comp. Biol. 1997. Use is necessary for good indel
  representation, but dissuaded for SNVs and higher coverage.
    
  -mp, --max-pile NUM        
  
  Maximum number of reads allowed to pile up at the same reference position (off).
  
  -mec, --min-explained-column 
  
  Minimum fraction of alignment column reads explained by genotype call.

  
  -mmp, --merged-max-pile
  
  Do pile up correction on merged files (off). Only applies when multiple
  mapped read files are given.

  -oa, --orientation-aware        
  
  Distinguish between forward and reverse reads when applying pile up 
  correction (off).
  Note that this options influences the output format. See section 4.2 for 
  details.
   
  -dc, --dont-clip    
  
  Ignore clip tags in mapped reads file (off).
  See section 4.1 for a description of the GFF file tags.

  -mu, --multi      
  
  Use non-uniquely matched reads (off). By default, only reads that are matched
  uniquely are parsed.

  -fl, --force-length NUM    
  
  Read length to be used (ignores suffix of read) (off).


SNP calling options:

  Threshold method related:
	In the threshold method, a SNP is called whenever a certain minimum number
	of a non-reference base, a certain minimum quality and a certain minimum 
	percentage of this base is observed in the read alignment. These three para-
	meters can be modified with the following options:

  -mm, --min-mutations NUM 
  
  Minimum number of observed mutations required for mutation to be called (5).

  -pt, --perc-threshold NUM 
  
  Minimum percentage of the mutational base for mutation to be called (0.3), 
  i.e. #most frequent non-ref base/ total #bases at candidate position

  -mq, --min-quality NUM  
  
  Minimum average base quality of mutational base for mutation to be called (10).

	
  Maq method related:
  In MAQ-like SNP calling, the genotpye g maximizing the posterior probability
  P(g|D)=P(D|g)*P(g)/P(D) given the data D. 
  See Li, H., Ruan, J. & Durbin, R. "Mapping short DNA sequencing reads and 
  calling variants using mapping quality scores." Genome Res. 2008. 
  and http://maq.sourceforge.net
  In contrast to MAQ, we use base quality values instead of mapping qualities.
  
  -qsnp, --snp-quality 
  
  Minumum quality of a variant to be called (10).
  
  -th, --theta NUM                        
  
  Dependency coefficient (0.85).

  -hr, --hetero-rate NUM 
  
  Heterozygote rate (0.001).


  Indel calling related:
  Indels are called whenever the absolute number of indel-supporting reads and
  the relative number (percentage) of indel-supporting reads exceed certain 
  minimum values. These parameters are set as follows: 

  -it, --indel-threshold  NUM
  
  Minimum number of indel-supporting reads required for indel to be called (5).

  -ipt,--indel-perc-threshold NUM   
  
  Minimum percentage of the indel-supporting reads for mutation to be called (0.3), 
  i.e. #reads supporting indel/ total #reads at candidate pos


Other options:

  -lf, --log-file FILE                  
  
  Write log information to FILE.

  -v,  --verbose       
  
  Verbose mode.

  -vv, --very-verbose
  
  Very verbose mode.

  -h,  --help             
  
  Print this help.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. File Formats
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reference sequence(s) must be given in a single Fasta file.
The format for the mapped read files is explained in section 4.1, the 
output file formats are described in section 4.2.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Mapped Reads General Feature Format
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SnpStore expects the mapped reads in General Feature Format (GFF). Read files have
to be sorted according to 1) chromosome (same order as in the reference sequence file) and 2) genomic start and 3) genomic
end position.

In general, the General Feature Format has at least 8 tab-delimited columns:
<seqname> <src> <feat> <start> <end> <score> <strand> <frame> [attr] [cmts]

For our input, we also require a 9th column to be present. The input columns
are (irrelevant fields are represented as "<>", their content doesn't matter):

<chromosome> <> <> <start> <end> <score> <strand> <> <ID=STR;AdditionalTags> 

Example:
chrX	AG	read	3427	3502	97.368	+	.	ID=AG_128_1_36_8556_3014;unique;cigar=76M;mutations=70A,72A;clip=0,3;quality=GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGEGGECEGGGGBGGGG@GDGCGCGCF%%%
chrX	AG	read	3429	3503	98.684	-	.	ID=AG_128_1_11_16882_16537;multi;cigar=6M1I69M;mutations=9T;quality=FFDDFFB==BBBBBDBBBB@B888DEBBBD@=DDFFBDFEBFFAFBDFEEDFBDDFFDEEFDFDFEDBE5D?BDD:

The score in this case is the percent identity in the read-to-reference alignment.
The 9th column can contain a number of tags. These are:


unique;				To specify that the match is the unique hit of the read.
multi;				To specify that the match is one among multiple best hits of the read.
suboptimal;		To specify that the match is a suboptimal hit of the read.

If none of these tags is given, the match is assumed to be unique.

cigar=..;			To specify how the read aligns with the reference. The cigar string
              must be given relative to the read sequence, i.e. in read sequence
              orientation. See example above.
mutations=..; To specify which read positions are different from the reference 
							(mismatches and insertions in the read). Also the mutations string is 
							relative to the read sequence, i.e. the numbers correspond to read 
							positions and the bases are the corresponding read bases.

The cigar string and the mutations string contain enough information to reconstruct 
the read sequence. Alternatively, the read sequence can be given explicitly 
by using the tag "read", e.g. "read=ACCAGCACA..T".
However, either the "read" or the "cigar" and the "mutations" tag need to be
specified, as this information is necessary for finding differences between reads 
and reference, i.e. for locating SNPs and indels.

clip=x,y;			To specify whether and how the read should be clipped. x bases will
              be clipped from the read prefix, y bases will be clipped from the
              suffix. In the above example, the last 3 bases of the first read
              would be clipped, i.e. discarded, leaving the read 73bp long.

quality=..;		To specify the ASCII quality string (quality value = ord(ASCII quality) - 33). 
							If qualities are given, these	 MUST be given as the last tag in the 9th column 
							(because of special characters contained in the ASCII quality string).



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Output Formats
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SNPS and indels are returned in two seperate vcf (V4.2) files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Example
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The folder "example" contains a mapped read file as well as the corresponding 
reference file.
If you cd into the example directory, you can run SnpStore in default mode with:

../snp_store exampleGenome.fa exampleReads.gff -o example1.snp.vcf -id example.indel1.vcf

This will produce two output files which are empty except for a header in the snp.vcf file.
In the little example, coverage is too low to permit any variants to be called in default
mode. By reducing the minimum coverage and indel threshold parameters to 2, the
output files should be filled:

../snp_store -it 2 exampleGenome.fa exampleReads.gff -o example.snp.vcf -id example.indel.vcf

To test the realignment option, you can further specify option -re:

../snp_store -re -it 2 exampleGenome.fa exampleReads.gff -o example.snp.vcf -id example.indel.vcf

In the resulting indel output file, two 1bp insertions should now have been
merged into one 2bp insertion.
