Description: SeqAn-Flexbar is a toolkit for the processing of sequenced NGS
reads based on the original Flexbar implementation in [1]. It is possible to
demultiplex the reads and order them according to different kinds of barcodes,
to remove adapter contamination from reads, to trim low quality bases, filter
N's or trim whole reads. The different tools are controlled through command
line parameters and can operate on both single- and paired-end read data.
