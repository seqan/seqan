Description: RazerS 3 is a tool for mapping millions of short genomic reads
 onto a reference genome. It was designed with focus on mapping next-generation
 sequencing reads onto whole DNA genomes. RazerS 3 searches for matches of reads
 with a percent identity above a given threshold (-i X), whereby it detects
 alignments with mismatches as well as gaps.
