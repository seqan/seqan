Description: sgip solves graphs isomorphism problems using a heuristic approach.
 This application gets canonical label of given graphs by heuristically 
 searching resolving sets, which determines a fixed order of graph nodes.
 .
 It serves in two application, one is to determine whether two graphs are 
 isomorphic, anther is to find canonical label(fingerprint) of one specific 
 graph.
