..description:
@glos:Concepts@ are a sort of 'interfaces' in generic programming.
They are not formulated as C++ constructs, but they are part of the documentation.
A @glos:concept@ is defined by a set of functions and @glos:metafunctions@, and
a class implements a @glos:concept@ if it implements the functions and @glos:metafunctions@ of this @glos:concept@.

...note:The list of @glos:concepts@ is not complete yet. Completing it is ongoing work.
